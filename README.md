# E-Commerce Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn in the e-commerce sector. Using a data-driven approach, the project analyzes customer behavior to identify the likelihood of customers discontinuing their transactions with an online retailer. 

## Contents

- **Business Understanding**: The project begins with an insight into the e-commerce sector's growth and the importance of understanding customer behavior, particularly focusing on customer churn. It emphasizes the significance of predicting customer churn for retaining valuable clientele and efficiently allocating resources.

- **Data Preparation**: The notebook involves importing necessary Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, XGBoost, CatBoost, PyCaret, and others for data manipulation and analysis. It loads a dataset named `data_ecommerce_customer_churn.csv` for analysis.

- **Data Analysis and Modeling**: This section involves exploratory data analysis, statistical tests, and predictive modeling using pipeline and pycaret.

- **Evaluation and Interpretation**: The section includes model evaluation and interpretation sections, where the performance of the churn prediction models is assessed, and insights are derived.

- **Conclusions and Recommendations**: This section concludes with key findings, potential business impacts, and recommendations based on the analysis.
